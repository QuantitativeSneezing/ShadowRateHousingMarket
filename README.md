Quantitative Easing programs have become somewhat of a mainstay of monetary policy in recent years. with numerous central banks embarking on aggressive easing policies during economic hardship. By design, such programs intentionally drive the cost of borrowing below zero, in real terms. While most evaluations of house price changes are adjusted for inflation, it may be useful to recapture this in order to evaluate real estate under such monetary conditions. In order to do so, we retrieve the "Shadow" federal funds rate
Retrieved from here: https://www.atlantafed.org/cqer/research/wu-xia-shadow-federal-funds-rate), which approximates the real cost of borrowing.
For the change in housing prices, we use the seasonally adjusted Case-Shiller U.S. national price index's mean return over 6 months (retrieved from https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CSUSHPISA).
